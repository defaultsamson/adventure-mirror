Question. How could your design your system so that each race could be easily generated? Addition-
ally, how difficult does such a solution make adding additional races?

Answer : We make each race a subclass of a character decorator. Each race decorator overrides the
necessary functions. As an example, this allows us to calculate the base damage for a combat, and 
then use decorator to apply a multiplyer to the damage done. This way, we do not have to create
new formulas to calculate damage, as classes are modifiers to the existing function of the base
class. Adding additional race just involves adding new modifications to the base character class.
Using a decorator also allows us to implement CLASS to the characters easier, as we just add a
CLASS decorator for the player character.

Question. How does your system handle generating different enemies? Is it different from how you 
generate the player character? Why or why not?

Answer :

Question. How could you implement the various abilities for the enemy characters? Do you use the 
same techniques as for the player character races? Explain.

Answer :
We are in fact using a similar technique as implementing abilities for character races.
